Hi, to whoever is reading this. This is my API template. It allows me to quickly create web API that stores data into a database like SQLite. It also has handles user authentication! 

## Installation 
Firstly, it is recommended that you create a virtual environment like the following. 
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Here is how you would install the dependencies and run the server!
```
.venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python3 server.py
```
